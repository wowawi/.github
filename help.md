Colours
--------
The app tries to use colour to try represent the "status" of talents and other data.

- A grayed out talent is a currently unavailable talent. This maybe due to a missing dependancy or not enough points available. Gray is generally used to indicate when something is unavailable.
- Green indicates that at least one point is available to be allocated to the talent.
- Yellow indicates that the no more points can be assigned to the talent. This is generally when the talent is complete, but it can also be used when no more points are available in the tree.
- Red indicates something is broken or invalid. For example a broken talent is coloured red when it is assigned a point but no longer has a valid dependancy.
- Orange is generally used as a warning colour
- Cyan and Pink are used to highlight allocations for compared builds
- Blue typically shows a button to other pages or functions
- Class colours are used through to try add extra flavour.

Compare Builds
----------------
The app allows you to compare your currently selected build to up to two other builds.

- Press on the Compare build button in extra functions menu
- Choose either one or two builds to compare to. Comparison Build A is coloured cyan, Comparison Build B is coloured pink.
- The tree header will re-render to show the builds you are comparing.
- The trees on each page will update to add an allocation indicator on each tree node. The allocation of the comparison build is only shown if it is different from the selected build.
- Hero tree icons are marked with an A, B to show which hero tree is active on the comparison build
- PvP talents are marked to indicate the Pvp talents in the comparison builds.
